# ecommercedata

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

A demo Flutter project with **GetX state management** and an **attractive bottom navigation bar** using `convex_bottom_bar`.

## ðŸ“¦ Packages Used
- **get** â†’ State management & navigation
- **convex_bottom_bar** â†’ Modern curved bottom navigation bar with bubble effect
- **dio** â†’ API calls
- **calendar_date_picker2** â†’ Custom date picker
- **cached_network_image** â†’ Optimized image loading & caching

- A simple `BottomNavController` stores the selected tab index as an observable (`RxInt`).
- `Obx` listens for changes and updates the UI reactively.
